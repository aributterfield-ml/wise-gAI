# Proverb Generator

This project leverages modern machine learning techniques to generate timeless proverbs from the biblical book of Solomon. The model generates high-level wisdom that is both trustworthy and universally applicable - avoiding the biases that often arise from LLMs trained on mass media. 

## Inspiration

In a world where AI models like ChatGPT often provide answers tuned to societal norms and user expectations. Unlike typical models, the Proverb Generator is designed to avoid agreeableness bias, ensuring responses remain authentic to the objective truth of wisdom. By drawing from the truths of Proverbs, the model delivers timeless insights that are trustworthy and self-contained. These proverbs supercede societal value-systems to shine wisdom on any question posed.

## Key Features

### Dataset
The training data is derived from the **book of Proverbs**, with each verse encoded for structure and meaning. The dataset includes:
- All self-contained proverb in the Book of Proverbs
- Annotations
- References

### Model Architecture
The system uses:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to process and analyze Proverbs


## Installation

- Note on Data:
The data, derived from the ESV book of Proverbs, is a product of Crossway. As such, I do not have the rights to share the dataset at this time. Please use your own licensed or open-source alternatives for experimentation.

## Results
The model successfully generates proverbs that align with the themes of wisdom, righteousness, and truth. Example:
- **Input**: 
    - "How can I build wealth over the next 5 years?"
- **Output**: 
    - Proverbs 13:11
    Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.


## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include a larger collection of wisdom literature.
- Obtain sharing rights and deploy as an API or website for broader accessibility.
- Improve response specificity using advanced context embeddings.
